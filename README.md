# terminal-portfolio
This is a Portfolio Website Design. To be exact, this isn't actually a website. This is basically a Web App that has a design similar to a Terminal Window to display information. I have organized this to be a portfolio for developers where the visitor has to navigate through different parts of the UI by typing specific commands on their keyboard and pressing Enter. It gives the whole experience a Terminal-like vibe and it's a lot of fun to play with.
